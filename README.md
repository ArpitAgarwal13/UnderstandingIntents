# UnderstandingIntents
Android Kotlin Project to understand the implementations of Intents and Runtime Permissions


This Project aims to implement and explain the use of Implicit Intent, Explicit Intent and Runtime Permissions.
Also since most of the code required for runtime permissions is boilerplate,
so if anyone wants to add any runtime permission in his/her app, can use the same piece of code
